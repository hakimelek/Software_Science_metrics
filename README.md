In Software Science, a computer program is considered to be a string of tokens which are divided into "Operators" and "Operands". Generally, any symbol or keyword group in a program that specifies an algorihmic action of the computer is considered an Operator, and any symbol used to represent data is considered an Operand. 

All Software Science meansures are functions of the counts of the Operators and Operands. 

# Metrics 
*n1 = number of unique operators
*n2 = number of unique operands 
*N1 = total occurences of operators 
*N2 = total occurences of operands 


*The Vocabulary, n= n1 + n2
*The Length, N= N1 + N2
*The Volume, V = N * log2(n) bits
*The Level, L = (2/n1) * (n2/N2)
*The Difficulty, D=1/L
*The Effort, E=V/L
*The computed programming Time, T=E/S seconds
